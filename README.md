## Currently Exploring
**🔗 Advanced Architectures and Design Patterns** - *Enhancing Robustness and Scalability*

I'm currently dedicating significant time to deepening my understanding of software architectures and design patterns that promote more robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. This journey includes:

**Vertical Slice Architecture**: Exploring how to organize code by feature, optimizing development and maintenance.

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Studying the separation of responsibilities between read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.

**DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**: Deep-diving into software modeling that reflects the complexity of the business domain, ensuring more aligned and effective solutions.

**Microservices**: Investigating the construction of systems as a collection of small, independent services, aiming for greater flexibility and resilience.

This exploration complements my passion for building high-quality software and represents the next step in my technical evolution as a developer.
